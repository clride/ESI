# ESR-Interpreter

 This is an interpreter for a custom esoteric programming language called ES.

**ESRI** or **ESI** for short.

The language itself is an extension of [Brainf***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck), an esoteric programming language developed as a joke, designed to have as few instructions as possible while still being turing complete.
I wanted to expand the instruction set to be able to create simple console apps with it, and decided to create my own interpreter.

As implied by the name, the language isn't very practical for real world use, but for me it was a nice learning project.

To see how to use it, look at the [Documentation](./Documentation) directory.
