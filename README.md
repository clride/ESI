# ES-Interpreter
 A simple interpreter for a custom esoteric programming language.
 
The language itself is strongly inspired by Brainf*ck, an esoteric programming language designed to have as few instructions as possible.
I wanted to expand the instruction set to be able to create simple console apps with it, and decided to create my own interpreter.
